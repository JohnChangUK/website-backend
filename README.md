## A Website with Sign Up functionality, RESTful API architecture, Routing, Sessions, Web Tokens

#### Created an API which manges CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete) operations on User Profiles
#### Implemented Promises to avoid large, nested callbacks (Callback Hell, Triangle of Death!)
#### Used Mongoose ORM (Object Relational Mapping) 
#### Concealed sensitive information (passwords) by hashing using BCrypt
#### Used JSON Web Tokens to further enhance authentication set up. When a User logs in, it creates a Token with a Secret Key that gets passed back with every subsequent request. It is then used to identify the logged in user on the profile page.
